In this project, we had to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

Recency, frequency, monetary value is a marketing analysis tool used to identify a company's or an organization's best customers by using certain measures.

We use the K-means clustering algorithm to determine the ideal segments of customers.
Here in k-means, we have to set k to the number of clusters we want, but figuring out how many clusters is not obvious from the beginning. We will try different cluster numbers and check their silhouette coefficient.
Silhouette score is used to evaluate the quality of clusters created using clustering algorithms such as K-Means in terms of how well samples are clustered with other samples that are similar to each other.
